    I wanted to create simple and effective application to keep track of jobs
    I've applied for. And decided to share it with everyone. JobTrackr is an
    open-source project. So, everyone can contribute, I review code changes and
    the contributors can see their changes live. I aim to make this community
    friendly and inviting. <br />
    Created with love. &#x1F497;
